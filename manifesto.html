                    To be a Christian is to live by the Alpha and Omega: the God who establishes and sustains the cosmos
                    and brings its
                    story to fruition.1 The God who plants the garden in Genesis is the God who inaugurates the New
                    Heaven and the New Earth
                    in Revelation. The God of creation is the God of the eschaton.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is today called “futurism” was first espoused by 19th and early 20th century Christian
                    theologians as an outworking
                    of Christian eschatology.2 “Futurism” could be described as an active, technological, and optimistic
                    vision of humanity's
                    role in the cosmos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Christian futurists do not seek to accommodate Christianity to modern expressions of secular
                    futurism, which we view
                    as—at best—a well-intentioned but shallow imitation of Christian eschatology. Instead, we seek to
                    subordinate futurism
                    to Christianity and the future to Christ and His church.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We foresee and work towards a future in which the Great Commission is fully realized and all of
                    humanity is collected
                    into the Body of Christ; the Church. This future will entail the perfect unity of God and Man that
                    is prefigured in
                    Christ and prophesied, in its fullness, in Revelation 21-22. The eschaton will be realized when
                    God's condescension to
                    humanity converges with humanity's ascension, unified as one Body, towards our divinely-ordained
                    potential.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    As Christian Futurists, we espouse these seven principles:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I. Mankind has been given a dominion mandate that encompasses the whole of the cosmos;
                </p>
                <p>
                    II. Technology, rightly-ordered towards the flourishing of the Imago Dei, refracts the glory of God
                    and does not obscure
                    it;
                </p>
                <p>
                    III. Our duty to direct all of human life towards Christ is the other side of our technological duty
                    to subdue and
                    orient matter and the cosmos towards the flourishing of life;
                </p>
                <p>
                    IV. This calling can only be fulfilled through, and is the necessary outworking of, the Kingdom
                    established by Christ
                    through his church;
                </p>
                <p>
                    V. All Christians must reject the modern innovations of pietistic and quietistic eschatology, which
                    de-emphasize the
                    role and agency of the institutional church in the plan of salvation and re-creation;
                </p>
                <p>
                    VI. Futurism is originally and inherently Christian. Optimistic futurism cannot sustain itself if
                    unmoored from its
                    Christian origins;
                </p>
                <p>
                    VII. The ongoing unfolding of human history along broadly futurist and theistic lines is a
                    prediction and a confirmation
                    of the ultimate truth of Christianity.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    I. “Mankind has been given a dominion mandate that encompasses the whole of the cosmos.”
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>God has given human beings a dominion mandate and thereby invited us to co-participate with Him
                        in the drama of
                        creation. The Psalmist wrote of his awe that God, who created all the “stars” in the cosmos,
                        should make mankind “a
                        little lower than the angels… You have given him dominion over the works of your hands.”3</li>
                    <li>Our duty to conquer evil is cosmic, not merely global, in scale. The cosmos is the setting of
                        the story that God is
                        creating with us. Not merely humanity or Earth, but all of “creation itself will be set free
                        from its bondage to
                        corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.”4</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            God will not merely create a new planet Earth, but a “New Heaven and a New Earth”—a new and
                            redeemed totality of all
                            things.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Revelation 21-22 describes the setting of a vast epic, celestial in scope, and points to a
                            new revelation, a new story,
                            and a new adventure on a far greater scale than we can now imagine. God promises us more
                            than eternal life: “Behold, I
                            am making all things new.”
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Christianity's very symbolism points to an active and universal messianism. In G.K.
                            Chesterton's words, the cross,
                            “though it has at its heart a collision and a contradiction, can extend its four arms
                            forever without altering its
                            shape.”5
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Techno-skeptical Christians urge that no part of the Bible is specifically focused on describing
                        extraterrestrial
                        space or commanding us to explore it. We respond that no part of the Bible specifically
                        discusses the New World. Yet
                        the cosmos, no less than the Americas, falls within the universal scope of the biblical story
                        and the Kingdom
                        mandate. If it is wrong to colonize Mars, then it was wrong to travel beyond the Pillars of
                        Hercules.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    II. “Technology, rightly-ordered towards the flourishing of the Imago Dei, refracts the glory of God
                    and does not obscure it.”
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Christian futurists affirm that humans are created in the Image of God. While the natural evil
                        afflicting humans is
                        the enemy of all mankind, humanity as such is something to aspire to and not to transcend.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Unlike secular transhumanists, the futurist theologian Teilhard de Chardin did not exalt
                            humanity's potential to
                            recreate ourselves into whatever form we might choose. An illustration of this distinction
                            can be found in Teilhard's
                            exalted view of biological sex. Teilhard does not view the complementarity of the sexes as
                            an accident which humans
                            might freely choose to discard or rearrange. Instead, he sees sex as a reality ordained by
                            God intended to reflect His metaphysical nature.6
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>We are incarnational, pro-human, and human-centric. While we support the responsible creation of
                        non-human
                        intelligences, we reject posthumanism's devaluation of corporeality and humanity.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Physical embodiment and homo sapiens, not simply intelligence in the abstract or unconscious
                            “entropy,” are objective
                            axes of value.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Artificial general intelligence (“AGI”) and robotics have, depending on how we respond to their
                        development, the
                        potential to promote or devastate human flourishing. “I have set before you life and death,
                        blessing and curse.
                        Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live.”7</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Unless accompanied by a new economic order, technology that eliminates most cognitive
                            employment could conceivably usher
                            in a caste system based on subsistence-oriented de facto serfdom. This could plausibly occur
                            if even the highly
                            competent poor cannot generate meaningful economic value, causing wealth to flow singularly
                            from a person's hereditary
                            ownership of compute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our duty to serve humanity requires that we wield a “rod of iron” against injustice.8
                            Christians must fight relentlessly
                            to ensure that any future AGI-based socioeconomic order is oriented towards human
                            flourishing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The imprisonment of the human race in a subsistence-oriented socioeconomic order must be
                            prevented by any means
                            necessary. Likewise, Christians must work and fight relentlessly to ensure that AGI serves
                            the ends of human flourishing
                            and the ultimate conquest of the cosmos by the Imago Dei.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We affirm the long Christian tradition of thinking rationally about the possibility of
                            non-human minds as represented in
                            biblical angelology and the works of thinkers like Augustine and C.S. Lewis. We
                            unapologetically affirm the reality of
                            spiritual warfare and the demonic while repudiating the recent tendency of some Christians
                            to assert that any non-human
                            mind we may encounter in the future will be ipso facto a demon.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Augustine, in discussing the biblical flood, entertained the possibility of “monstrous
                                races” and of “antipodes”—people
                                who live on the southern hemisphere of the earth. While Augustine was skeptical of both
                                monstrous races and antipodes,
                                he did not assert—as some modern Christians might—that all sentient beings that exist
                                are cataloged in the Bible.9
                                Likewise, Augustine nowhere suggested that monstrous races or antipodes, if they exist,
                                would be ipso facto demons.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                God, in His Word, never promises or even suggests that the only minds that exist, or
                                will exist, in His universe are
                                human minds. The assertion that sentient AGI cannot be possible because it is not
                                mentioned in the Bible
                                therefore—ironically—has no support within the Bible.

                                Just as this does not mean we minimize the reality of the demonic, it also does not mean
                                that we minimize the dangers
                                posed by AGI.

                        Pasteur. Christian
                        innovators are driven by the conviction that “What you did for one of the least of these, you
                        did for me.”10 This
                        statement, as Simone Weil observed, could be called the foundation of all Christian ethics. When
                        a researcher cures
                        a disease, he obeys this commandment and furthers the divinely-sanctioned conquest of the
                        universe. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Our duty to conquer the universe is itself an eschatological outworking of our duty to
                            protect the least of these from
                            natural evil, whether that evil is Alzheimer's disease, the future immolation of the Earth
                            by the sun, or the heat death
                            of the universe.

                            Christ taught that sickness exists in the world as an enemy to be conquered. Victory over
                            natural evil is won not merely
                            by Christ Himself, but by Christ through His Body—His people. “It was not that this man
                            [born blind] sinned, or his
                            parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him. We must work the works of him
                            who sent me.”11
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Teilhard de Chardin wrote that God has offered us the world “unfinished, so that [we] may
                            draw sustenance from the
                            intense satisfaction of, in some small way, giving You to Yourself.”

                            Christ himself also stated that his followers would do “greater works” than him.12 This
                            statement may not be explicable in
                            terms of individual piety, but it is perfectly sensible as a description of the future
                            activity of the Body of Christ in
                            the World. Christ germinated a Kingdom that will “work the works of [the Father]” upon
                            matter and the cosmos.

                        <li>In Christian history, heresies often come in pairs of opposites. The heresy of Monophysitism
                            began as an
                            overreaction to Nestorianism. Arianism, one of Christianity's most famous heresies, was
                            essentially the inverse of
                            Docetism, one of its earliest. </li>

                                Today, some Christians react to the religious challenge of transhumanism by lapsing into
                                a form of
                                death-worship—exalting sickness, degenerative aging, and death as intrinsic goods which
                                give life meaning.13 For these
                                Christians, medicine will eventually reach some arbitrary point at which scientists must
                                stop combatting ill-health and
                                other forms of natural suffering.

                                These Christians are unlikely to specify when exactly this arbitrary point will arrive,
                                probably because they have not
                                yet settled that question themselves.

                                Death-worshippers are perhaps a kind of “conservative,” but what they are conserving is
                                something like 19th century
                                romanticism, not biblical Christianity. In the Bible, sickness and death are never
                                described as positive in any inherent
                                sense. Death is The Last Enemy to be Destroyed, destined to be cast into the lake of
                                fire with the devil.14 In Proverbs 8,
                                Wisdom—personified as a woman—concludes her monologue with the condemnation: “All who
                                hate me love death.”

                <li>Christ's church cannot serve its eschatological goals by accommodating itself to the world, for

                        The entire pattern of Jesus' rhetoric is oriented towards a fierce exclusivity. He regularly
                        rebuked people for
                        compromising and diluting their core principles.16 Jesus' rhetoric seems calculated to spit in
                        the eye of the kind of
                        cosmopolitanism that was imposed by Judah's cultural enemies from the period of the judges to
                        the Maccabees.

                        his flesh the dividing wall of hostility” between the diverse people groups of mankind so that
                        he can reconcile all of

                            William F. Buckley. The fatal weakness in Voegelin can be seen in the fact that, in New
                            Science of Politics, he condemns
                            the English Puritans as Gnostics simply because they believed in physically fighting their
                            enemies on the battlefield.

                            In other words, Voegelin ended by condemning Puritans because they believed what Christians
                            from Ambrose of Milan
                            through nine crusades have always believed: that it is our duty to physically combat evil in

                            We reject “don't immanentize the eschaton” as incoherent on its face. Christians have always
                            believed that the eschaton
                            is a future epoch of real time and will therefore be immanent when it arrives. In contrast,
                            Voegelin saw the eschaton
                            as, by its nature, a sentimental abstraction and hence not something that would ever arrive
                            in the real future. No
                            Christian can logically agree with this position.

                            the many demiurge hypotheses
                            that have followed Fred Hoyle, and the Participatory Anthropic Principle of J.A.
                            Wheeler—therefore represents the
                            Western intellect shedding its atheism and rediscovering the fundamental premises of
                            traditional religion.24

                        No phenomenon in the social history of religion is so miraculous as the spread of the
                        monotheistic God of Jacob
                        throughout the world.

                        <li>
                            When the prophets of the Bible were writing, no one on Earth practiced genuine monotheism
                            except theologically
                            conservative Jews. Yet these authors foretold that the Jews were a "nation of priests" who
                            would call the nations of the
                            world to worship the God of Jacob.25
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Today, more than four billion people—over half of the world's population of under 8
                            billion—profess a belief in the God
                            of Jacob and thereby acknowledge the Jews as an ordained nation of priests.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The prior probability that prophecies of messianic global monotheism would be fulfilled,
                            supposing these prophets lacked
                            genuine prophetic knowledge, is minimal. If the prior probability of any form of theism is
                            substantially higher, even if
                            still modest, then we should conclude that the biblical prophets were given genuine
                            prophetic knowledge.

                        Where major competing descriptions of the universe have fundamentally disagreed with the
                        monotheistic tradition, the
                        experimental evidence has vindicated the God of Jacob.

                        <li>
                            The West entertained the idea of an uncreated, past-eternal universe as a viable
                            cosmological model from the premodern
                            Aristotelians until Fred Hoyle's Steady State Model, which Hoyle affirmed in order to avoid
                            the theological implications
                            of an absolute beginning. Yet the monotheistic tradition of a past-finite, created universe
                            has been repeatedly
                            vindicated by the experimental evidence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aristotelian cosmology maintained, well into early modernity, that the heavenly bodies of
                            the cosmos were perfect and
                            unchanging. In contrast, the Christian tradition has always promised that “the creation
                            itself will be set free from its
                            bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the Children of God.”26

                    <li>
                        Progress towards AGI is a prediction and a confirmation of the existence of God. If God created
                        the universe in order to
                        germinate intelligence, then the creation of AGI is more probable than if our own intelligence
                        arose accidentally from
                        indifferent naturalistic laws.

                            Architects and proponents of secular cosmic theogonies, including Frank Tipler, James
                            Gardner, and Paul Davies, likewise
                            predict that our universe is coded with a “cosmic imperative” to create life and mind. These
                            “Omega point” theorists
                            have accordingly claimed that their theories predict the existence of extraterrestrial life,
                            the discovery of an
                            alternative form of microbial life on Earth, convergent evolution towards sentience in
                            non-primate species, and the
                            eventual creation of artificial general intelligence. At the time of this writing, the
                            latter possibility looks
                            increasingly inevitable.

                    size; it can never be larger or smaller. But the cross, though it has at its heart a collision and a
                    contradiction, can extend its four arms for ever without altering its shape. Because it has a
                    paradox in its centre it can grow without changing. The circle returns upon itself and is bound. The

                    [6] In Sketch of a Personalistic Universe, Teilhard put the absolute necessity of sex in unambiguous
                    terms: “The mutual attraction of the sexes is so fundamental that any explanation of the world
                    (biological, philosophical or religious) that does not succeed in finding it a structurally
                    essential place in its system is virtually condemned.”

                    <br>
                    [13] Notably, if sickness, degenerative aging, and death are intrinsic goods, then Jesus’ miracles
                    were largely acts of lessening the amount of good in the world. C.S. Lewis wrote "Confronted with a
                    cancer or a slum the Pantheist can say, ‘If you could only see it from the divine point of view, you
                    would realize this also is God.’ The Christian replies, ‘Don’t talk damned nonsense.’”
                    <br>
                    [14] Revelation 20:14.
                    <br>
                    [15] Matthew 5:13.
                    <br>
                    [16] Matthew 7:13.

                    [17] Ephesians 2:14-16
                    <br>
                    [18] For Fyodorov, the Christian task was to “become a union of immortal beings” by making the
                    “blind forces of nature into an instrument of universal resuscitation.”
                    <br>
                    [19] The Christian prays, but does not “bow down his head like a reed”: instead, he seeks to “break
                    every yoke. Isaiah 58.
                    <br>
                    [20] Our claim that God has an active role for Christians to play in the story of eschatology should
                    not be read as a claim that Christians can control or foreknow the timing of eschatological events.
                    See Matthew 24:36.
